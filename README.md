# ResetVisionFramework
Easy, Quick, Fully Customizable, Get your Vision code up and running in minutes!

### Introduction


### Features
Fully customizable framework allowing you to do whatever you want to do with your tracking. A GUI that auto generates vision code to your team's needs in a matter of seconds for beginners and experts! Able to set how many cameras, what operations wanted, what to calculate (CenterX, CenterY), filter by aspect ratio, GPU acceleration option, communication library and more! Use the code generator to get started quickly or start coding manually using the framework.

Detailed framework allowing beginners to quickly learn how to code vision is C++ as well as giving full extensive options for experts to do various operations, filtering, and calculations.
### How to Use
Code Framework
1.Download the folder from the github which contains a ReseteVisionFramework.cpp and a CmakeLists.txt
2. First open up CMakeLists.txt and follow the commented instructions and what it does and what to change to fit your needs. 
3. Then open up the .cpp file and go over the framework. The comments will explain out what each section does, give some examples, and give you a template code to write out what you need. If you want to perform functions that are not in the examples, the OpenCV Documents are a great place to find them.
4. After going through the template and having created your code, save both files and now you have a completed .cpp and CMakeLists.cpp


GUI Generator
1. Click on all the options you want
2. Press Submit
3. It will auto generate a .cpp file (and a CMakeLists.txt if selected)
4. ???
5. Profit
6. Blame Hardware if it does not work

Final Steps
1. Now that you have your .cpp and CMakelists.txt, go into the build folder
2. run cmake.. 
3. Then run make
4. then ./filename.cpp

Note: this requires CMake and C++ compiler to already be installed. If you are not using CMake, just use the .cpp on the platform you want.
